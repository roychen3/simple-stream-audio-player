# Simple Stream Audio Player

Play linear16 base64 audio files using `AudioContext`. The audio data can be streamed to the frontend in chunks (for example, via websocket), and the frontend will start playback as soon as chunks are received, ensuring seamless audio without interruption.

## Application Scenario: Google Text-to-Speech

You can use this player to stream audio generated by Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. For example, after receiving base64-encoded linear16 audio chunks from your backend (which proxies Google TTS), you can play them in real-time:

## Simple Usage

Stream and play audio data using websocket:
```ts
const player = new StreamAudioPlayer();

websocket.onmessage = (event) => {
  player.addChunk(event.payload, 16000);
  player.play();
};
```
